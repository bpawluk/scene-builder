# scene-builder
GUI desktop app for rendering 3D scenes. It loads formatted data files that define the scene and displays it within an interactive UI view. 

The app contains three ortogonal views of the loaded scene and the fourth screen that presents the perspective projection. The UI lets you tune the perspective view by changing the viewer position, far clipping plane and the field of view angle.
